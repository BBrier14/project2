## Overview
The Empire RPG application is an online, text-based RPG Forum. Users can create a profile as an author and post stories to the category of their choosing. If the user is not sure what to write and is seeking inspiration, they can access the writer's block page, answer a few questions about their interests, and be presented with some ideas to assist them. Users can also play music if they so choose.
