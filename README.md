# Empire RPG
## Overview
The Empire RPG application is an online, text-based RPG Forum. Users can create a profile as an author and post stories to the category of their choosing. Users can also play music if they so choose. 
## How It Works
The app will initially take the user to the home page. The user then can either go straight to the forums and see all of the posts, or select a category to see the posts in that specific category, or click on user to create a new author. A post can only be created once an author exists. Authors can also be deleted, and posts can be edited. Once a user creates a profile, they can write a post. The post requires a title and body, a corresponding author, and a category to be placed in. Once the user submits their story, they can go back and edit it from the forum page, or delete it.
## Technologies Used
This app uses many different technologies such as: Node, MYSQL2, Express, Sequelize, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, & JQuery.
## Issues
This project came with a fair share of issues. Originally, the intent was to have the posts be interconnected with the user. The code we were writing failed to make those connections, and as we dove into fixing the problems, the code became so messy we decided to scrap it all and start fresh. Another issues we ran into was with a section we planned on creating that would take in information from the user, and give them writing prompts based on that information. We were unable to get the information to make a connection to the databse to display the writing prompts.
## Future Features
Features we would like to add with more time on the project:
- Reply buttons
- Connect Author to Post
- Writing prompts function
- "Like" button
- Allow the user to create new categories
